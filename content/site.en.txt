Description: least [ecology and art laboratory for a society in transition] brings together scientists, artists, thinkers, engineers, and economists to share knowledge and know-how, foster co-creation with local groups, experiment, act together, share and learn, in order to regenerate society and its functioning by mobilising everyone’s resources. It encourages alternative ways of functioning based on common activities that go against the individual competition.
