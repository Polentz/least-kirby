Maintext: **least** [ecology and art laboratory for a society in transition] is an association born from the reflections of eight people from different backgrounds who converge towards the common observation that everything has to be built and (re)created, starting with our practices, our jobs, our habits, and our entire daily life. **least** aims, through its actions, for a profound change in our way of life that is made necessary by the current ecological, social, and health upheavals.

Plaintext: Together, the members have constituted a programme in the political sense of the term, i.e. a series of actions with a view to achieving a result. This ambitious programme initiates and supports artistic, scientific, ecological, social and participatory approaches. To this end, it aims to implement tools capable of contributing to the development of collective thought and action that will change the world.
