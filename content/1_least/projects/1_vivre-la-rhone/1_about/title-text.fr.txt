Maintext: Vivre le Rhône (Living the Rhone) is a project created by least and Natural Contract Lab, an artistic practice led by Maria-Lucia Cruz Correia that advocates an ecology of repair based on a dialogue with the bodies of water in profound ecological transformation.

----

Plaintext:

The places identified along the Rhone become sites of regenerative encounters between human and non-human communities. Here, practices of walking and collective weaving, care rituals, bodily experiences, and the mourning of landscapes come to recognize the river's rights. The project’s aim is the design, inspired by restorative justice practices, of a protocol of reciprocal care to counteract the ecocide of aquatic life and (re)connect to the ancient power of water. 

The project unfolds through a former phase of transdisciplinary research and a series of residencies, artistic practices, and workshops characterized by regular exchanges between the artistic team, the participants, and local communities involved in the creative process.
