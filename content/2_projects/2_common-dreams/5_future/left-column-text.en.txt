### what’s next

In the spring, the students will build and launch their *Flotation School* on Lake Geneva. The island will then be open for visitors to gather and learn thanks to tools and activities designed by the students themselves. Local actors, such as BIG (Biennale Insulaire des Espaces d’Art de Genève), will include the Flotation School in their programme. In September, the platform will be moved to Parc Rigot and transformed into an installation allowing students to share their experience with the community.
