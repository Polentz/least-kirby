### what we did

Since autumn 2022, Maria Lucia Cruz Correia and Maxime Gorbatchevsky have been meeting regularly with students from Sismondi College to reflect on new ways of living and acting together in order to address climate change. The students were introduced to these issues in workshops with experts and professionals from multiple disciplines (engineering, biology, architecture, permaculture and nutrition).
