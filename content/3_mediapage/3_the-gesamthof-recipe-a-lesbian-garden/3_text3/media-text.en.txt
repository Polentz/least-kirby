**Intersectionality & botany.**
The connection between botanical classification systems and people classification systems illustrates how the same mode of thinking is applied to both our gardens and us as people. Botany is full of anthropocentrism and it is not bad to be aware of this, the lesbian garden reframes this use of gardens. Suddenly the invisible norm of who usually benefits from gardens is no longer in place. 'Lesbian' means nothing if it is not connected to racialized people, to class differences, to living with disabilities, to age and all the other aspects gathered in Kimberl√© Crenshaw's intersectional theory. To put intersectionalism into practice means asking the 'other question': who benefits from this garden? 
- *Bees* opens up the discussion on native plants, their genomes and diversity in gardening. 
- *Plants* opens up the discussion of the colonial past, systems of economics, and who has a 'right' to extract.
- *An audience that visits art spaces *(the Gesamthof is accessible trough the Kunsthal Extra City) opens up the question of class, inviting the 'other' in, lgbtqi+ friendly spaces etc.
- *Me* opens up the question of access & responsibility that comes with privilege. 
 
To ask the other question means that we are aware of others. Is the Gesamthof appropriate for children? Should it be? Should we take out all the poisonous plants, the pond, the bees hotel etc if we want children to be safe? There is a fence around the Gesamthof to keep wandering people out, because the garden is certainly not safe for everyone and not everyone is safe for the garden.
 
**Atemporal gardening.**
Every place carries a past into its future. The past is not a distant island, it's very much with us in this thick present (again Donna Haraway's words, the thick present is like a composted layered presence). In my garden I don't want to be blind for what is present from the colonial past. It takes effort to find out how all of this is linked, how the history of botanical gardens is woven into to the need for classifying. It is hard work to learn about colonialism and gardening because it's not as clearly visible as for instance plantations and slavery are linked to cotton and coffee. A garden is often more like a collection of plants bedded into a designed space and the colonial past is not a comfortable topic in garden programs. It takes visiting the past to find out what is here today. For me it meant going to the botanical garden in Meise and looking at the plants brought back from colonies. It also meant digging in the past of the Gesamthof's location in the monastery, who was gardening here before me? How can I work with ecology towards a better understanding?
 
Note: People suffer from plant-blindness (J. H. Wandersee and E. E. Schussler, publication 'Preventing Plant Blindness' from 1999), it means we don't see the plants that we don't know and by giving garden tours one can share the awareness of this cognitive bias. In a lesbian garden the cognitive bias rings a bell, without representation people have a hard time discovering what is different about them. Many lesbians don't know that they are a lesbian when they grow up, and they see themselves through the norm of a heterosexual society while a part of who they are remains empty for themselves. Like plant-blindness, this abstraction of a norm can be countered by looking at the differences as positive characteristics.
 
**Ongoing change.**
A garden is a nice form of art & activism, it is a healthy activity that helps to relieve stress and anxiety. It is working towards change by educating one's self and each other, it is becoming aware of nature and changing our way of thinking. It is pleasant: the scent, the view, the touch, the sound, it's a nice place to be. I become very aware of the moment when I sit in the Gesamthof. Time passes differently for all the inhabitants and visitors, and some of us spend a lifetime in this garden (most of the pigeons do) while for me it is very temporary. I will miss the Gesamthof when the new owners arrive in the monastery. But it doesn't make it less worth it, on a larger scale gardening means ongoing change, and we can enjoy every moment of it. Never is a garden a fixed thing, it is never finished and there is no 'end', it just moves into different places.
