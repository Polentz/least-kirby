*Dear Listener,*

*Since June 2022, Natural Contract LAB and **least** have been developing accompanied walks, collective weaving, healing rituals, somatic experiences and restorative circles—all practices that have helped us rethink humans’ relationship with the Rhône.*

*What you’re about to hear is the first episode of a three-part podcast, retracing the experiences of those who have grown closer to the river by walking.*

*I’d like to give you a few tips before you start listening to this podcast.*

*If you can, head to Vernier Village in the Geneva countryside. Take some good headphones with you and your water bottle with water or your favourite herbal tea. Once you've arrived, start playing the audio.*

*You can then walk down to the river and take the Chèvres footbridge, as shown on the map below.*
