*Il pane selvaggio* (Wild Bread, 1980) is an essay by Italian philologist, historian and anthropologist Piero Camporesi about the **experience of hunger** in Europe in the modern age. Hunger in the Global North may appear to be a distant issue, but **access to adequate, healthy and affordable food is still affected by profound inequalities** both across the world and within single communities.

The “wild bread” to which the title refers describes the bread of the poor, who, to cope with grain shortages in times of famine, began to grind flour from roots, seeds, mushrooms—anything that could fill their stomachs and could be gathered freely on the limited non-private land available. **The end product was stale, toxic and non-nutritious bread, which often also caused hallucinatory states.**

The educated, rich and powerful men who reported the history of famines had the option of neglecting the experience of the most fragile people. Camporesi has therefore traced the accounts of those who could never aspire to a piece of white bread on their table in **folk literature**, as in the 16th-century song *Lamento de un poveretto huomo sopra la carestia *(Lament of a Poor Man Over Famine).
