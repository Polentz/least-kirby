### Vivre le Rhône: a podcast by Audrey Bersier and Martin Reinartz

*Dear Listener*,

*Since June 2022, Natural Contract LAB and **least** have been developing accompanied walks, collective weaving, healing rituals, somatic experiences and restorative circles—all practices that have helped us rethink humans' relationship with the Rhône.*

*What you’re about to hear is the first episode of a three-parts podcast, recounting the experiences of those who have grown closer to the river by walking.*

*I’d like to give you a few tips before you start listening to this podcast.*

*If you can, head to the Seujet dam, in downtown Geneva. Take some good headphones, writing materials and a bottle filled with water or your favourite herbal tea. Once there, start the podcast.*

*It’s up to you whether you choose to stay on the dam or walk along the river, towards Pont Butin for example, as shown on the map below. *
