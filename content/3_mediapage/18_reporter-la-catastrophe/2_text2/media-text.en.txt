Laying aside, for the moment at least, the prejudices that kept me away from WWTAWWTNTAGW, I discovered a light-handed book that raises various interesting points. In short: **why does climate change, our future, interest us so little?** Why do we see it as such an abstract and remote problem? What are the cognitive barriers that are sedating, tranquillizing and preventing us from having even the slightest real fear for the fate of the planet? Stoknes identifies five, which can be summed up more or less as follows:

*Distance. *The climate problem is still remote for many of us, from various points of view. Floods, droughts, bushfires are increasingly frequent but **still affect only a small part of the planet**. The bigger impacts are still far off in time, a century or more.

*Doom. *Climate change is spoken of as an unavoidable disaster that will cause losses, costs and sacrifices: it is human instinct to avoid such matters. We are predictably averse to grief. Lack of practical solutions on offer exacerbates feelings of impotence, while messages of catastrophe backfire. **We’ve been told that “the end is nigh” so many times that it no longer worries us**.

*Dissonance. *When what we know (using fossil fuel energy contributes to global warming) comes into conflict with what we’re forced to do or what we end up doing anyway (driving, flying, eating beef), we feel cognitive dissonance. To shake this off, **we are driven to challenge or underestimate the things we are sure about (facts) in order to be able to go about our daily lives with greater ease**.

*Denial. *When we deny, ignore or avoid acknowledging certain disturbing facts that we know to be “true” about climate change, we are shielding ourselves against the fear and feelings of guilt that they generate, against **attacks on our lifestyle**. Denial is a self-defence mechanism and is different from ignorance, stupidity or lack of information.

*Identity. *We filter news through our personal and cultural identities. We look for information that endorses values and presuppositions already inside our minds. Cultural identity overwrites facts. **If new information requires us to change ourselves, we probably won’t accept it**. We balk at calls to change our personal identities.

There are obviously hundreds of other reasons why we still hold back from a strategy to mitigate climate change: economic interests, the slowness of diplomacy, conflicting development models, the United States, India, sheer egoism, “great derangement” and all the other things we’ve come to know so well over the years. But Per Espen Stoknes empirically suggests a way forward. Catastrophism and alarmism don’t work. **We need to find *a different tone* to dispel the apathy of our eternal pres**ent.
