*If the end is nigh, why aren’t we managing to take global warming seriously? How can we overcome the apathy of our eternal present? The following article is taken from (link: https://not.neroeditions.com/medusa-newsletter/ text: MEDUSA), an Italian newsletter that talks about climate and cultural changes. Edited by Matteo De Giuli and Nicolò Porcelluzzi in collaboration with (link: https://not.neroeditions.com/ text: NOT), it comes out every second Wednesday and (link: https://medusanewsletter.substack.com/about text: you can register for it here).

*There is no alternative* was one of Margaret Thatcher’s slogans: wellbeing, services, economic growth… are goals achievable exclusively by doing things the free market way. 40 years on, in a world built on those very election promises, *There is no alternative* sounds more like a bleak statement of fact, a maxim curbing our collective imagination: there is no alternative to the system we’re living in. Even when we’re hit by crisis, in times of unrest, exploitation and inequality, the state of affairs finds us more or less defenceless. **There’s no escape – or we can’t see it: our room for manoeuvre has been fenced off**.

**Why can’t we take global warming seriously?** Because it’s one of those complex systems that operate, as Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams affirm in their (link: https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/148-inventing-the-future text: Inventing the Future), “on temporal and spatial scales that go well beyond the bare perceptual capacities of the individual” and whose effects “are so widespread that it’s impossible to exactly collocate our experience within their context”. In short, **the *climate problem* is also the result of a *cognitive problem***. We are lost in the corridors of a vast and complex building in which we see no direct and immediate reaction to anything we do and have no clear moral compass to help us find our way.

It was to pursue these issues further that I decided to read *(link: https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/what-we-think-about-when-we-try-not-to-think-about-global-warming/ text: What We Think About When We Try Not to Think About Global Warming)* (hereafter *WWTAWWTNTAGW*) by Norwegian psychologist and economist Per Espen Stoknes, a book I’d been putting off reading for some time for a series of reasons that turned out to be only partially valid. First of all, there was my vaguely scientist prejudice: despite being interested in the issue, I find that the back cover of *WWTAWWTNTAGW* sounds more like front flap blurb for some self-help publication rather than for a serious work of popular science. I quote: “Stoknes shows how to retell the story of climate change and at the same time create positive, meaningful actions that can be supported even by negationists”. Then there was the title, *WWTAWWTNTAGW*, a cumbersome paraphrase of a title that is already, in itself, the most ferociously paraphrased in the history of world literature. And lastly — still on the surface only – there was the spectre of another book by Per Espen Stoknes, published in 2009, the mere cover of which I continue to find insurmountably cringeful: *(link: https://www.greenbooks.co.uk/business-economics-policy-education/money-and-soul.html text: Money & Soul: A New Balance Between Finance and Feelings)*.
